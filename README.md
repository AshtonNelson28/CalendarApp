## IDEA/TODO
- Duplicate Indication & Toggle
    - displayDuplicate = false (default);
    - OR duplicateBlacklist = [string];
    - Column to indicate & toggle duplicate of the num
- [x] Popover open w/ more info when click on LAB+ or REC+
- Better department display. Add/Map Abbreviation to it.
- Tooltip!
- Theme switcher / Dark/Light mode toggle
- [x] Time filter.
- [ ] Duration filter.
    - [x] and coloring
- Days blacklist filter (current one is whitelist)
- The Telescope command search experience
    - tab and shift-tab to cycle
    - sorting
        - searching 'EE' should have 'EE' before 'AEEE'
- Settings window/sidebar/container?
    - Hide class with avl == 0
- [x] credit hour color
- [x] Department & Semester highlight current selected
- Display spring & fall exclusivity
    - Can do this by comparing course number between semester during the parsing?
        - This can give false positive tho?
- Give more info on what the type mean
    - LAB -> Lab
    - RES -> Research
    - REC -> Recreational?
    - IND -> Independent Study?
    - SEM -> Seminar
- Generate something Google Calendar or Outlook can import?
    - Require knowing how long the semester is
        - Or maybe there's a predictable pattern (like second week of December or something)
- [x] your selected course is also visible when you switch department or semester
- More themes
    - Gruvbox

## WONTFIX / IMPOSSIBLE
- Directly adding course to LSU database
- Course Pre-requisite or Information that are not available or derivable from the booklet
    - Those would require **very** complex parsing from [this page](https://catalog.lsu.edu/content.php?catoid=27&navoid=2448)
- Better course title
- Display ***ALL*** courses from ***ALL*** department for a given semester
    - Lag
    - There's too many filters & sorting
    - Compromise: selected class are visible even when you switched to a new department/semester
